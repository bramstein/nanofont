# Nanofont

Nanofont is a tiny font for testing web font format support in browsers. It comes in three flavours:

* TrueType
* WOFF
* WOFF2

## Usage

Include them like any normal web font. To test if the font loads, use the "a" character (0x61). It will have the same width and height as the em-box. Remember to gzip the TrueType and base64 versions before using them.
